I'll try to occasionally post some of the slides of my talks, in a way that there's not too much overlap.

### Heidelberg 2025
At Heidelberg.ai / hosted by  German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)
* Why SSL and why vision-language research is fun
* Generalisation from LLMs 
* Parameter-efficient finetuning for Transformers
* TimeTuning: further tuning a DINO model with videos
* Post-pretraining of DINOv2 to improve performances
* [**Find the slides here**](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/g1lqoq6yve9qotzmgg42j/Heidelberg_Asano_2025.pdf?rlkey=z6wqsyis3272dfmzeplyqce6g&dl=0)


### Birmingham 2024
At Univ. Birmingham Synergising the Human Brain and Arficial Neural Networks Workshop
* Why care about SSL, what is SSL
* TimeTuning: further tuning a DINO model with videos
* 1-video pretraining: better models than ImageNet from a single video
* 1-image distillation: achieving 69% top-1 on IN-1k with only 1-image as training inputs
